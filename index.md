# AnaCal Shear Profile or Abell 360 in ComCam Data

```{abstract}
This technote presents the measurement of the shear profile for the Abell 360
galaxy cluster using ComCam data processed with the AnaCal pipeline. We detail
the procedures involved in bright star masking, source selection, and the
estimation of tangential and cross shear around the cluster center. The
resulting shear profiles provide key insights into the mass distribution of
Abell 360 and demonstrate the capabilities of AnaCal in processing early LSST
data.

## Introduction
The Rubin ComCam observing campaign conducted at the end of 2024 targeted seven
fields, including the low ecliptic latitude Rubin SV 38 7 field. This field
hosts the Abell 360 galaxy cluster, an intermediate-mass cluster at redshift
$z = 0.22$, which we use as a commissioning case study to demonstrate Rubin’s
capabilities for weak lensing analyses of galaxy clusters. This technote
presents the lensing shear profile of the Abell 360 cluster as measured with
the AnaCal pipeline. The analysis includes source selection, masking, and shear
estimation steps, serving as an end-to-end demonstration of AnaCal’s
performance on early ComCam data.
