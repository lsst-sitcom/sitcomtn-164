# AnaCal Shear Profile or Abell 360 in ComCam Data

```{abstract}
This technote presents the measurement of the shear profile for the Abell 360 galaxy cluster using ComCam data processed with the AnaCal pipeline. We detail the procedures involved in bright star masking, source selection, and the estimation of tangential and cross shear around the cluster center. The resulting shear profiles provide key insights into the mass distribution of Abell 360 and demonstrate the capabilities of AnaCal in processing early LSST data.
